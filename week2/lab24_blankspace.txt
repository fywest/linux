Nice to meet you p2p
Where you've been?
I can show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, (sins)
Saw you there and I thought oh my_god
Look at that face, you look like my next mistake404
Love's a game, wanna play
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny rumors fly
And I know you've heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
And I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
